# Overview

The orch is a keyboard PCB.

It has:

* A mostly ortholinear layout
* Key sizes that fit most GMK keycap sets
* 1.25u super/meta/command keys
* 19mm switch spacing
* An arrow key cluster
* A function key column
* USB-C
* A rotary encoder
* No stabilizers unless you want one for a 2U spacebar
* Optional 2U spacebar or 2 1U keys

# Key Layout

The key layout looks like this. (Thanks to [Keyboard Layout Editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/) for the image.)

# Case

[Case files are in the case directory](case) and include a cutout for the rotary encoder. The "closed" layer requires some dremeling or filing to make room for the USB connector. Thanks to the [swillkb Plate & Case Builder](http://builder.swillkb.com/). There are two bottom case files included. One of them has smaller holes that are meant for tapping (to secure the screws directly into the back case layer), and the other has "open" holes that an M2 screw will fit through (to secure the case together with nuts).

# Schematic

[There is a PDF of the schematic here](assets/schematic.pdf).

# AVR Notes

These are just some notes on programming the ATmega32U4. [The datasheet is here](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-7766-8-bit-AVR-ATmega16U4-32U4_Datasheet.pdf).

## Programming

ISP headers are included in the "No Legs" Tag-Connect format. You need a Tag-Connect cable and retaining clip board to connect to it. For example, if you have an AVRISP mkII programmer, you need the ["No Legs" cable](https://www.tag-connect.com/product/tc2030-idc-nl) and the [retaining clip board](https://www.tag-connect.com/product/tc2030-retaining-clip-board-3-pack).

## Fuses

Default values are:

```
E:F3, H:99, L:5E
```

### Extended

| Name | Bit | Value | Status | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| - | 7 | 1 | Unprogrammed | Unused |
| - | 6 | 1 | Unprogrammed | Unused |
| - | 5 | 1 | Unprogrammed | Unused |
| - | 4 | 1 | Unprogrammed | Unused |
| HWBE | 3 | 0 | Programmed | Pin used to force bootloader after reset |
| BODLEVEL2 | 2 | 0 | Programmed | 4.3V brown-out reset threshold |
| BODLEVEL1 | 1 | 0 | Programmed | 4.3V brown-out reset threshold |
| BODLEVEL0 | 0 | 0 | Programmed | 4.3V brown-out reset threshold |

Hex value is `F0`.

### High

| Name | Bit | Value | Status | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OCDEN | 7 | 1 | Unprogrammed | OCD disabled |
| JTAGEN | 6 | 0 | Programmed | JTAG enabled |
| SPIEN | 5 | 0 | Programmed | SPI enabled |
| WDTON | 4 | 1 | Unprogrammed | Watchdog timer in interrupt mode |
| EESAVE | 3 | 1 | Unprogrammed | EEPROM preserved on chip erase |
| BOOTSZ1 | 2 | 0 | Programmed | Default maximum boot size |
| BOOTSZ0 | 1 | 0 | Programmed | Default maximum boot size |
| BOOTRST | 0 | 1 | Unprogrammed | 4.3V brown-out reset threshold |

Hex value is `99`.

### Low

| Name | Bit | Value | Status | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CKDIV8 | 7 | 1 | Unprogrammed | Don't divide clock by 8 |
| CKOUT | 6 | 1 | Unprogrammed | Don't output clock |
| SUT1 | 5 | 0 | Programmed | Crystal oscillator with BOD enabled |
| SUT0 | 4 | 1 | Unprogrammed | Crystal oscillator with BOD enabled |
| CKSEL3 | 3 | 1 | Unprogrammed | Low power 16MHz crystal oscillator |
| CKSEL2 | 2 | 1 | Unprogrammed | Low power 16MHz crystal oscillator |
| CKSEL1 | 1 | 1 | Unprogrammed | Low power 16MHz crystal oscillator |
| CKSEL0 | 0 | 1 | Unprogrammed | Crystal oscillator with BOD enabled |

Hex value is `DD`.

### Setting Fuse Values

avrdude commands to set the fuse values with an AVRISP mkII programmer:

```
avrdude -p m32u4 -c avrispmkII -U efuse:w:0xF0:m
avrdude -p m32u4 -c avrispmkII -U hfuse:w:0x99:m
avrdude -p m32u4 -c avrispmkII -U lfuse:w:0xDD:m
```

Note that the extended fuse will always show as `C0` with avrdude (despite the datasheet saying that the first four bits are unprogrammed/`1111`).

You may need to erase the chip before you set the fuse values:

```
avrdude -p m32u4 -c avrispmkII -e
```

The first time flashing should be done with a programmer like the AVRISP mkII and you should compile QMK to include the bootloader in the firmware file (using `:production`). I have [a fork of the `qmk_firmware` repository here](https://github.com/htpkbs/qmk_firmware/tree/orch) that I may or may not try to get merged at some point.) To compile the `orch` branch with the QMK CLI:

```
qmk compile -kb orch -km default:production
```

I've had luck setting a custom bitclock setting (`-B`) for the initial flash when using the mkII, but this may not matter. For example:

```
avrdude -p m32u4 -c avrispmkII -U flash:w:orch_default_production.hex:i -B 154.37
```

You should now be able to flash regular (non-`:production`) firmware that doesn't include the bootloader over USB using QMK Tookbox.
